# Digital Diary

Bullet journaling a method of journaling and note-taking that uses bullet points as the core structure. The main idea behind the bullet journal is that you jot down quick notes instead of writing long sentences. It is a combination between a diary, a planner, and a to-do list. Digital Diary is a browser-based bullet journal all on one webpage. It implements dynamic digital aspects that a physical bullet journal does not have, such as the display of the time and date, a moving carousel to display a user's photo log, and the immediate ability to change the color of certain elements on the page and the font style.
 
 ## Journaling and Mood Tracking
 There are 8 text areas that allow a user to organize scheduling, jot down reminders, create to-do lists, brainstorm, and note any other organizational tasks onto a single webpage. Any input provided by the user will be saved to their local storage until it is manually deleted or the user clears their cache and cookies. ```1``` of ```31``` daily affirmations and songs will be randomly displayed every time the user refreshes the page.

A user can also keep track of their mood by selecting a color that corresponds to a certain emotion. This is noted by the color key. The color input above the circles provide a user interface element that lets a user specify a color, either by using a visual color picker interface or by entering the color into a text field in ```#rrggbb``` hexadecimal format.
 
 ## Photo Log 
 A user can keep a photo log by uploading image links. A total of 20 images can be viewed through a carousel, each lasting a week from its creation date until it is removed.
